### Code and data from Kandlikar et al. "Functional traits predict species responses to environmental variation in a California grassland annual plant community"

This repository contains all the code and data required to recreate the results and figures. All analyses are run through the file `complete-analysis.Rmd`, which sources the two functions saved in the `functions/` subdirectory. The script sources data files saved in the `data` subdirectory. `complete-analyses.html` and `complete-analyses.md` are the rendered version of the RMarkdown file, which can be viewed either by downloading (html file) or directly on the Github repository (markdown file). See https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.17.387076 for a preprint of this manuscript.
